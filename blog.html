  <h2>Baking soda + Honey + Water = Face Brightening Cleanser</h2>
  <p>Combine one tablespoon of honey with one teaspoon of baking soda in your palm. Rub them together with a few drops of water and then massage gently in circular motions on your face. Let sit for a minute then rinse thoroughly with warm water. Throw in a little baking soda for a scrub - which helps boost circulation but doesn't tear off your top layer of skin - and voila! Glowing skin.</p>

  <h2>Brown Sugar + Milk + Vanilla = Cheapest All-Over Scrub Ever!</h2>
  <p>Brown sugar is the ultimate base for a good scrub and we could easily spout off dozens of effective combinations, but this basic recipe is all you need to polish your whole body back to its smooth self. Just combine two parts milk with one part brown sugar and a few drops of pure vanilla extract (if you have it - if not, omit) in a bowl. In your shower or tub, gently scrub in tiny circles from head to toe. Rinse and bathe normally. For an extra boost of moisture and good-for-you nutrients, add an egg yolk. In place of brown sugar, white sugar could be used.</p>
